        <h1>Fun Fact about Corbett National Park</h1>
        <p>Did you know that someone who loves hiking and has traveled to Corbett National Park in India might have trekked through the same trails where the legendary hunter-turned-conservationist Jim Corbett once roamed? Corbett National Park, established in 1936 as Hailey National Park, is not only India's oldest national park but also a haven for wildlife enthusiasts. It's famous for its Bengal tigers, and hiking through its lush landscapes offers a unique opportunity to experience the diverse flora and fauna that inspired Corbett's conservation efforts.</p>
